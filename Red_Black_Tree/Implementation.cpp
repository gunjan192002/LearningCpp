// it is self balancing bst tree 
// its used when isnsertion and frequently needed
// Every node has a color.
// The root is black.
// Every leaf is a special node called NIL (with no key)
// NIL is black.
// If a node is red, then it's children are black [ie no 2 red trees in a row]
// Every path from root to leaf has the same number of black nodes.
// /Red-black trees are one of many search-tree schemes that are
//“balanced” in order to guarantee that basic dynamic-set
//operations take O(lg n) time in the worst case.
// we will do insertion ,deletion and searching in rbt
